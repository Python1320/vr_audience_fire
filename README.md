# VR Audience Fire/Water

Makes you combustible in VRChat. Also get extinguished by water sprays.

### Marketplace + Demonstration video üõí

 - https://python1320.gumroad.com/l/vr_audience_fire

### Includes üì¶üì¶üì¶
 
 - Installation instructions üëâ
 - VRCFury Unity Avatar drag-and-drop prefab to become combustible üì¶
 - Open source utility application (needed for automatic fire triggering!) üõ†Ô∏è

### What it doesn't do üõë

 - Allow you to send fire
 - Respawn afterwards
 - Fires in worlds cannot make you catch on fire. Worlds cannot have contact senders :(

### How does it work
When someone uses a flame thrower, they have a [contact sender](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/avatar-dynamics/contacts/) with tag "fire". Your avatar then has a contact receiver (from this addon's prefab) with the same tag "fire" which sets an avatar parameter "fire" temporarily. This is relayed via [OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview) to helper application, which sends another OSC message back to VRChat to turn on [boolean avatar parameter](https://creators.vrchat.com/avatars/animator-parameters/) named `fire_effect`, which stays on, and is networked to other players so they can see fire. This networked status can then be used to turn on a fire gameobject (from the prefab), which has a fire particle effect.
Extinguish works the same, but turns off fire effect, etc.
Additional ideas can be programmed to the helper application, like eventual random extinguishing, or PiShock support.

### Requirements üìì

 - SteamVR
 - Windows (might work on linux)
 - VRChat (ChilloutVR should also work, but is not documented and probably no longer needed. Resonite also does not need this addon.)
 - Some knowledge about [OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview)
 - Your custom avatar source code. Used in examples: [TongueyToastacuga by 'a distraction'](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ekIiFBnzJNhH2a6wwYLo2s5G-VuUlIY5)
 - [Unity editor](https://creators.vrchat.com/sdk/current-unity-version/) for avatars 
 - [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/getting-started)

### Installation Video Help üìπ

 - [Using VRCFury prefab assets in Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDvzfLa82yI)

### Installation ‚ÑπÔ∏è

**NOTE**: *Help improve the introductions by [updating this readme](https://github.com/Python1320/vr_audience_fire/edit/main/README.md)*

**Unity**

 1. Install [Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) and add [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/getting-started).   
     You also need your avatar as a project!   

 2. In creator companion
    1. Add `vr_audience_fire` by pressing "add to VCC" in [this](https://python1320.github.io/vr_audience_fire/) page.
    2. Install the "VR Audience Fire" package to your avatar. (*Remember to install VRCfury if not already installed!*)
    3. Open the avatar in unity

 3. Recommended: backup avatar now!

 4. Find the audience fire package and prefab inside it and drag and drop it into the avatar (note: the prefab must be put under avatar in the hierarchy but NOT inside armature/body, see picture):
 ![avatar drag and drop to hierarchy](docs/prefab_drag_and_drop.png)
 
 5. To make the prefab's fire surround your avatar, you need to tell it which mesh should be used for fire emission.   
Do this for both water and fire:
![set particle effect fire to](docs/set_particle_shape.png)

 6. optional: the prefab comes with an example sound effect, you may want to remove it (go under the prefab in hierarchy and remove the audio component from the fire game object)

 7. Optional: test with [gesture manager](https://github.com/BlackStartx/VRC-Gesture-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-sdk-30)
 
 8. Publish your avatar

 9. Remember to enable OSC and to regenerate OSC config in VR!

  - VRCFury will automatically add a new [expression menu](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/action-menu#expression-menu) entry and you will be able to toggle the fire on and off there. Test it VRChat and see if it works. 


**Helper Application** üõ†Ô∏è *(required)*
 1. Download the latest `vr_audience_fire_helper.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/Python1320/vr_audience_fire/releases)
 2. Extract the ZIP file to somewhere
 4. Run `vr_audience_fire.exe` once. *If unsure you can run it a second time and it will give an error about already running. If this does not happen the program is somehow crashing.*
 5. The program runs in background. Look in task manager for status.
 6. In case of trouble run `vr_audience_fire_console.exe` to see debug output. You may also need to set debug to true in `config.json`
 7. Look in [`config.json`](https://github.com/Python1320/vr_asmr_petting/blob/main/src/config.json) for additional settings.
 8. The program quits when SteamVR quits
 9. Optional: Enable helper autostart in SteamVR settings 

### Troubleshooting üéØ

 1. Ensure you have Avatar Self Interact enabled in the VRChat settings menu: ![img/self-interact.png](img/self-interact.png)
 2. [Enable OSC](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-overview#enabling-it)
 3. Use [OSC Debug](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/osc-debugging) to see if are receiving any data
 4. Make sure your VRChat SDK is updated in the companion app! VRCFury usually requires the latest VRChat SDK.

The application generates a `debug.log` file on start. This can provide clues on what is wrong.

### Known Issues üìå

https://github.com/python1320/vr_audience_fire/issues

### How to change the sounds 

 - Navigate to the prefab and into the fire and just replace the sound file with your own

### Helper app automatic start ‚ÑπÔ∏è

After launching the helper exe successfully once, you should be able to enable autostart in SteamVR:
![SteamVR settings has autostart option](docs/autostart.png)


### NO SUPPORT NO WARRANTY

This is a hobby for me, paying only gives you access to the asset files. Payment does not give support. I may or may not have time to look at github issues but that's about it.
No warranty of any kind!
I cannot afford supporting you, and you cannot afford my support, sorry. Feel free to ask someone else to fix things for you.
